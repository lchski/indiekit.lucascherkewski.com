# set up (2022-11)
- copied [Paul's setup](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/paulrobertlloyd-indiekit)
- set up a MongoDB Atlas instance (per [recommendation in instructions](https://getindiekit.com/configuration/#application-mongodburl-url); )
	- also considered standing it up in:
		- [Railway](https://docs.railway.app/databases/mongodb), since that’s where I’ll host the app, but it seemed beefier and less managed than needed
		- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/mongodb) (which is itself just a MongoDB Atlas instance), since that’s where I host other stuff and may move the app, but it seemed maybe too expensive an instance of Atlas
	- currently using the Atlas free tier, may need to bump to serverless for reliability, but want to see usage first
	- set IP range to 0.0.0.0/0 (open to the internet), since we don't know the Railway IP address—this is another argument in favour of moving to, e.g., GCP, where we can better isolate this stuff
- set up env vars:
	- [MONGO_URL](https://getindiekit.com/configuration/#application-mongodburl-url)
	- [GITHUB_TOKEN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@indiekit/store-github), [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
		- did a fine-grained token (the new kind), scoped to just my site and this repo
		- permissions: `Read and write` for `Contents`, otherwise default
	- [MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@indiekit/syndicator-mastodon), via `/settings/applications` in Mastodon
		- permissions: `read:statuses`, `write:media`, `write:statuses`
- setting up syndicating:
	- plugin is built-in—if you try to load `/syndicate`, you’ll get a 404, because the route is only configured for POST requests
	- [per the docs, syndication doesn’t happen automatically](https://getindiekit.com/introduction#share)—recommend setting up a post-deploy hook
	- in Netlify site settings, `Build & deploy`, `Deploy notifications`, set up an outgoing webhook:
		- `Event to listen for`: `Deploy succeeded`
		- `URL to notify`: `https://indiekit.lucascherkewski.com/syndicate?token={token from indiekit status page}`
